Analysis of sentiment from tweets
Tweets have a lot of text which can be mined to get relevant information.
In this project, I have used the Twitter REST API to get a streaming input of tweets. Analyzed the tweets to see overall sentiment (positive/negative). This info can also be used to find the popular hashtags and the overall sentiment of a US State etc.
Code is mainly in python
